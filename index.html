                <li>Underground Drainage Monitoring System Using IOT
                       <p> <b>Description:</b> The project aimed at designing proper underground infrastructure as part of the
                        smart cities initiative. This includes monitoring of underground water pipelines, drainage
                        monitoring for the purpose of keeping the city clean. If the drainage system is not monitored
                        properly, it may lead to blockage and sewage overflow which in turn leads to contamination of
                        pure water resulting in the spreading of infectious diseases. Also, it becomes inconvenient for
                        the government persons to detect the accurate location of the manhole which is facing issues
                        such as blockage arising due to unwanted waste materials, an abrupt increase in the level of the
                        water as well as various toxic gases such as methane, carbon monoxide, etc.</p></li>
                <li>Intelligent Hospital Management System Java Project
                        <p><b>Description:</b> In this system, Intelligent hospital is an application that is developed to retrieve
                        patientâ€™s details easily. In this application doctor directly collects all the information of the
                        patient regarding the disease like patient name, age, gender, B.P, weight blood test, urine test
                        place, and the description of the disease. A doctor can analyze the disease of the patient easily
                        within no time with this information. A doctor can search for the symptoms and Find the cure
                        to the disease easily. Depending on the result found related to the patient's symptoms doctor
                        will prescribe medicines to the patient. When a doctor Funds new symptoms he can add the
                        related information in the database which he can analyze the same disease in the future without
                        any waste of time. A doctor can view the graph which shows the level of various diseases in
                        various locations.</p></li>
